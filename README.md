It features a 2D scene with a car that is controlled by the player with the keyboard. 

* The goal of the game is to pick up packages and deliver them.
* The car changes color to indicate if it is carrying a package or not.
* The car's speed increases when it passes over rectangular speed boosts and returns to the default speed when there is a collision.

The repository also includes the three (3) c# scripts that were needed for the game. [Delivery.cs](https://github.com/konstantinosy/driverDeliveryGame/blob/main/Delivery.cs), [Driver.cs](https://github.com/konstantinosy/driverDeliveryGame/blob/main/Driver.cs), and [FollowCamera](https://github.com/konstantinosy/driverDeliveryGame/blob/main/FollowCamera.cs).
